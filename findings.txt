After question 4 ruled out mystery board 2 as the 'impossible' board,
I used two techniques to determine which of board 1 and board 3 were
'hard' and 'extremely hard'. 

Firstly I timed the respective function calls. Due to inconsistent results
I meaned 10 separate executions. Mystery board 1 had a mean of 144743 
microseconds for each call (SD = 854.762) compared to mystery board 3 
posting 4910.7 microseconds for each call (SD = 118.095).
Due to the relatively small nature of the SDs and the huge gap between the
two timings, it is safe to conclude mystery board 1 was the 'extremely hard'
board and mystery 3 was 'hard'.

To compound these findings, I added a counter to an overloaded solve_board 
function to count the number of recursions taken to solve each board. Mystery 
board 1 involved 421546 recursions compared to mystery 3's 5173 recursions, 
showing the same result as previous.

'Difficult' is a relative term contingent on the method of solving used. Humans
may find certain boards easier/more difficult than this algorithm - this
could be due to a more thoughtful and diligent approach instead of the
workhorse trial and error approach employed here. For this reason the approaches
used to measure difficulty may not be appropriate for every sudoku board comparison,
but in this case it is safe to say Mystery Board 1 was 'extremely difficult'
and Mystery Board 3 was 'difficult'.
